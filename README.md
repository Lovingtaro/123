### Usage

For Chinese developers:

    Please fork this repo first
    git clone your-repo-url
    cd OpenWMS-Frontend
    npm i -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
    cnpm i -g @angular/cli
    cnpm install
    ng serve --env=dev

For others:

    Please fork this repo first
    git clone your-repo-url
    cd OpenWMS-Frontend
    npm install
    ng serve --env=dev

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:4200/

### HMR Support

You don't want the browser to refresh the whole window when you modified some code, so we have HMR module.

@angular/cli doesn't support HRM by default, we have to handle this by ourselves, please refer to this article on Medium: https://medium.com/wizardnet972/hot-module-replacement-with-angular-cli-5fc7a3ae4a9c

In order to run this repo in HRM mode, please run this command:

    npm run hmr

**NOTE:**@angular/cli V6.x has integrated HMR support, so just run this in your terminal:

    ng serve --hmr

### Switching environment

There are three config files located in src/environments, named environment.dev.ts, environment.mock.ts, and environment.prod.ts.

"environment.dev.ts" will be used when no parameter was detected from your terminal, if you want to switch to other envirmont, try this:

    ng serve -e mock

### License

MIT

You can use this project whatever you want, there is no need to notify me in advance, because Chinese developers are always busy.
